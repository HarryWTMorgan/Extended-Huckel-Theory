Now we write the expression for the radial overlap between two orbitals.
This consists of sums over 8 indices - 4 for each atom (a and b)

This formula comes from the article "Integrals: Overlap" by James J. P. Stewart
in the Encyclopedia of Computational Chemistry, vol. 2

m (magnetic quantum number) is given to the function directly rather than
extracted from the basis set - this is because for the purposes of this
calcuation we align the orbitals along their own principal axes so it
is not practical to use the m values in the basis set.
Working this way enables us to calculate overlaps between s and px/py orbitals,
and sigma/pi overlaps for a pair of p orbitals.
